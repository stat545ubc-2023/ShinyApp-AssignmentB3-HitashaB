## Assignment 3b - Shiny App Development 
For this assignment, I created a Shiny App for the Gapminder dataset.
This application provides a plot showing the relationship between GDP per
capita and life expectancy. The application also contains a table that shows
all variables for each entry. The sidebar contains two more features where you 
are able to select a country from the drop down list and change the range of 
years for which you would like to explore the data from. 
These interactive inputs also change the table and graph to correspond to the 
information selected.

### Contents
Here you will find 2 files. The README file and the app.R file.

### Features
* Plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita.
* Table listing all entries with all variables.
* Side Panel that contains:
  * Slide bar to choose the range of years you wish to see the data for.
  * Drop down list to choose the country you wish to see the data for.
  
### Data
The gapminder dataset can be used by installing and loading the gapminder 
package in RStudio (gapminder library).
